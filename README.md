## What is Data Science

Data science is an area that aims to study and analyze structured and unstructured data. Data science is a mixture of programming, mathematics, statistics and probability (among others, as it is an interdisciplinary area) where this knowledge is used to manipulate, explore and extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

Data Scientist is a curious person who is passionate in always learning. He/She needs to acquire knowledge in mathematics, statistics, probability and programming. All this knowledge will help him/her to manipulate and extract information from structured and unstructured data. The Data Scientist is also a person who knows how to tell a story from the results he/she has obtained.

More about Storytelling [here](https://storynet.org/what-is-storytelling/)

*When the companies are hiring people for a data science team, maybe a data scientist or an analyst, or a chief data scientist, the tendency would be to find the person who has all the skills, that they know the domain-specific knowledge. They're excellent in analyzing structured and unstructured data. And they're great at presenting and they've got great storytelling skills. So if you put all this together, you will realize you're looking for a unicorn. And your odds of finding a unicorn are pretty rare. I think what you need to do to is to see, given the pool of applicants you have, who has the most resonance with your firm's DNA. **Because you can teach analytics skills, anyone can learn analytics skills if they dedicate time and effort to it. But what really matters is who's passionate about the kind of business that you do.** Someone could be a great data scientist in the retail environment, but they may not be that excited about working in IT related firms or working with gigabytes of weblogs. But if someone is excited about those weblogs, if someone is excited about health-related data then they would be able to contribute to your productivity much more so. And I would say if I'm looking for someone, if I have to put together a data science team, I would first look for curiosity. Is that person curious about things not just for data science but anything like, are they curious about why this room is painted a certain way, why do the bookshelves have books, and what kinds of books? They have to have a certain degree of curiosity about everything that is in their vision, that they look at. The second thing is do they have a sense of humor because, you see, you have to have a lighthearted about it. If someone is too serious about it, they probably would take it too seriously, and would not be able to look at the lighter elements. The third thing I think, and I think the last thing that I would look for if I had to have a hierarchy, the last thing I would look for are technical skills. I would go through the social skills, curiosity, and sense of humor. The ability to tell a story. The ability to know that there is a story there. And then once all is there then I would say, well, can you do the technical side of it? **And if there is some hope or some sign of some technical skills, I would take them because I can train them in whatever skills they need. But I cannot teach curiosity. I cannot teach storytelling. I cannot certainly, instill sense of humor in anyone**.*
